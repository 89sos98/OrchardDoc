Orchard currently has a very simple main menu feature that is a list of menu item text and links to display, accessible from the **Navigation** link in the Orchard admin panel.  When you add an item to the main menu using the page or blog post editor screens, a new entry is added here.  You can use this screen to rename, reorder, and remove menu items. (This will not delete the content item; it will only remove the menu item).

You can also add arbitrary URLs in your menu, whether external or pointing to a page in your Orchard site, by adding a new menu item.  Note that only items added in this way have an editable URL on this screen. Content item URLs must be edited from the editor screen for that content item instead.

To reorder menu items, type a numeric index in the "Position" textbox.  Position indexes can be any of the following format:

* **Integer**: 1, 2, 3, etc.
* **Decimal**: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc
* **Multi-part number**: 1.1.1, 1.2.1, 1.2.2, etc

When you are satisfied with your changes, click **Update All** to update the main menu of your site (effective immediately).
